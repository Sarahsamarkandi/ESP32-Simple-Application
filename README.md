# ESP32-Simple-Application
In the Smart Methods electrical, electronics, and IoT track, I developed a simple ESP32 application using Wokwi, an online simulator for microcontrollers. The application demonstrates controlling an LED with a button press. When the button is pressed, the LED turns on, and when released, the LED turns off. The circuit design involves connecting the button to GPIO 14 and the LED to GPIO 2 of the ESP32. The code sets the button pin as an input with an internal pull-up resistor and the LED pin as an output. This project provided a practical introduction to input and output control in embedded systems.
